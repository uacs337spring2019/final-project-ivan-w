cyberspace

This webpage allows a user to freefly a spaceship in an online space (cyberspace). The user is able to see other spaceships near them.

Known problems:
The server refuses to store the first spaceship to attempt to join the server. However, this isn't really a problem because that user can still see others even if they won't be given a sprite key. Actually, I think I know what the problem is!!!
