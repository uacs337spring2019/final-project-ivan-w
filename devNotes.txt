I've run into some problems getting my server to store and return all of my spaceships. However, I have a nice free-flight app that's pretty nice so far. I'm leaving in a dummy spaceship with the engine on low so you can see something cool.

Okay, so what's the plan?

FACT: people in space shoot one another
ALSO FACT: people in cyberspace shoot one another

Things I still want to add:
	Black holes -> either tunnel through them or DIE (maybe a bit of both...)
	Lasers, fighting, explosions (red, orange circles), etc.
	Multiplayer
	Google Ads (so I can get rich)
